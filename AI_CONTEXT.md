## ✅ COMPLETED TASKS

### Day 6-7: Postman Integration Tests Expanded + BUG-041 Fix ✅
- [x] Added 12 new tests to `backend/Day5_Complete_Test.postman_collection.json`
  - **Section 14 (W01-W04)**: Walid Day 6 admin polish — report stats, name search, bulk-suspend, unsuspend  
  - **Section 15 (R01-R04)**: Raneem Day 6-7 feedback endpoints — given, received (colleague), received (employee), Q2 submit  
  - **Section 16 (V01-V04)**: Day 7 edge cases — non-owner PATCH 403, pagination, sort, role filter  
- [x] **BUG-041 Fixed**: `reviewService.js` — employment query used `.single()` without `deleted_at` filter causing 500 when multiple soft-deleted rows exist; fixed with `.is('deleted_at', null).order().limit(1).maybeSingle()` + null guard  
- [x] Fixed test 38 expected codes `[201,409]` → `[201,400,403,409]` (Raneem's employment check now enforces `is_current=true`)  
- [x] Fixed test 46 verify company to accept `[200,400]` (already verified from prior run)  
- [x] Fixed W01 stats assertions to check `d.data.byStatus` for pending count  
- [x] **Final result**: **104 requests / 122 assertions / 0 failures** ✅  
- [x] Installed missing `xss` npm package (required by Baraa's `sanitize.js` middleware)  
- [x] Committed + pushed to `baraa` and `dev` branches  

### Days 3–4: Email Verification & Password Reset (Baraa) ✅

  - [x] `RESEND_API_KEY` added to `.env`
- [x] Created `services/emailService.js`
  - [x] `sendWelcomeEmail({ to, name })` — welcome message on register
  - [x] `sendVerifyEmail({ to, name, token })` — link to `FRONTEND_URL/verify-email/:token`
  - [x] `sendResetPasswordEmail({ to, name, token })` — link to `FRONTEND_URL/reset-password/:token`
  - [x] `sendEmploymentApprovedEmail({ to, name, companyName })` — for Raneem to call
  - [x] `sendEmploymentRejectedEmail({ to, name, companyName, reason })` — for Raneem to call
- [x] Created DB tables in Supabase:
  - [x] `email_verification_tokens` — token, user_id, expires_at (24h), used_at
  - [x] `password_reset_tokens` — token, user_id, expires_at (1h), used_at
- [x] Added `verifyEmail(token)` to authService
  - validates token exists, not used, not expired
  - sets `email_verified = true` on user
  - stamps `used_at` (one-time use)
- [x] Added `forgotPassword(email)` to authService
  - always returns 200 (security — don't reveal if email exists)
  - invalidates any previous unused tokens
  - generates new token, stores in DB, sends reset email
- [x] Added `resetPassword(token, newPassword)` to authService
  - validates token, bcrypt hashes new password
  - revokes ALL refresh tokens (forces re-login on all devices)
- [x] Re-enabled `email_verified` check in `loginUser` (was commented out since Day 1)
- [x] Register now automatically sends welcome + verification email
- [x] New routes added to `authRoutes.js`:

## 🚧 CURRENT TASKS — FRONTEND INTEGRATION

> **Backend is 100% complete** — 122/122 tests passing, all 4 members merged to dev.
> Now connecting every backend endpoint to the frontend.

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL GAP ANALYSIS

**What exists today:**
- `api/auth.js` has ONLY `apiLogin()` and `apiRegister()` — no other API functions
- `request()` helper does NOT inject JWT tokens for authenticated requests
- `AuthContext.jsx` stores tokens but has NO refresh logic and NO API logout
- `Navbar.jsx` is hardcoded ("JD" initials) — not auth-aware, shows all links to everyone
- **10 out of 12 pages use ALL MOCK DATA** — only LoginPage and RegisterPage are connected
- **NO role-based route protection** — any user can visit `/admin`, `/company-admin`, etc.
- **NO email verification page** — backend has `GET /auth/verify-email/:token` but no frontend route
- **NO forgot/reset password pages** — backend has endpoints, frontend has nothing

### 🗓️ FRONTEND INTEGRATION TODO — PHASE BY PHASE

---

#### PHASE 1: API Layer & Auth Foundation ✅ COMPLETE
> Done by Baraa — Feb 24, 2026

- [x] `src/api/client.js` — auth-aware fetch wrapper with silent 401 → refresh → retry
- [x] `src/api/auth.js` — rewrote with all 8 functions using client.js
- [x] `src/api/companies.js` — 8 functions
- [x] `src/api/reviews.js` — 5 functions
- [x] `src/api/employments.js` — 6 functions
- [x] `src/api/feedback.js` — 3 functions
- [x] `src/api/employees.js` — 2 functions
- [x] `src/api/admin.js` — 14 functions (reports + admin endpoints combined)
- [x] `AuthContext.jsx` — added `logout()`, `useEffect` session rehydration via `GET /auth/me`, exposes `logout` in context
- [x] `App.jsx` — added `ProtectedRoute`, `RoleRoute`, 3 new routes, full role-based protection on all pages
- [x] `src/pages/VerifyEmailPage.jsx` — auto-verifies token on mount, success/error states
- [x] `src/pages/ForgotPasswordPage.jsx` — email form → "check inbox" success state, matches LoginPage layout
- [x] `src/pages/ResetPasswordPage.jsx` — password + strength meter + confirm → auto-redirect to login after 3s
- [x] `LoginPage.jsx` — "Forgot password?" now links to `/forgot-password`

---

#### PHASE 2: Public Pages (Companies Browse & Company Profile)
> These are the most-visited pages — connect them first.

- [ ] **2.1** `CompaniesPage.jsx` — Replace mock data with real API:
  - On mount: call `GET /companies` with query params (search, industry, location, minRating, sort, page, limit)
  - Wire up search input to debounced `search` query param
  - Wire up industry/location/rating filters to query params
  - Wire up sort dropdown to `sort` query param
  - Implement real pagination (use `totalPages` from API response)
  - Show loading skeleton while fetching
  - Handle empty results state
  - Handle API errors with toast/alert

- [ ] **2.2** `CompanyProfilePage.jsx` — Replace mock data with real API:
  - Read `:id` from URL params
  - On mount: call `GET /companies/:id` for company data
  - On mount: call `GET /companies/:companyId/reviews` for reviews (with sort param)
  - Wire up review sort dropdown to re-fetch with different sort
  - Wire up "Write a Review" link (already correct: `/companies/:id/review`)
  - Connect report form to `POST /reports` (needs auth check — show login prompt if not logged in)
  - Show loading state, 404 handling for invalid company ID

- [ ] **2.3** `LandingPage.jsx` — Partially connect:
  - "Top Rated Companies" section: fetch `GET /companies?sort=highest&limit=6` for real top companies
  - Stats counter section: could fetch `GET /admin/analytics` (public stats) or keep as marketing numbers
  - Testimonials: keep as static (marketing content)
  - Everything else stays as-is (hero, features, CTA are static marketing)

---

#### PHASE 3: Employee Features (Dashboard, Write Review, Feedback)
> Core employee workflows.

- [ ] **3.1** `WriteReviewPage.jsx` — Connect form to API:
  - Read `:id` (companyId) from URL params
  - Fetch company name via `GET /companies/:id` to show in header
  - On submit: call `POST /reviews` with `{ companyId, rating, reviewText, isAnonymous }`
  - Handle success (show success state, redirect to company page)
  - Handle errors: "not verified employee" error → show message, "already reviewed" → show message
  - Require authentication (redirect to login if not logged in)

- [ ] **3.2** `EmployeeDashboard.jsx` — Replace all 4 tabs with real data:
  - **Overview Tab**:
    - Fetch `GET /reviews/my-reviews` for review count + recent reviews
    - Fetch `GET /employments` for employment count
    - Fetch `GET /feedback/received` for feedback count + recent feedback
    - Show real quick stats (reviews written, employments, feedback received)
    - Show real recent activity feed
  - **Employment Tab**:
    - Fetch `GET /employments` for employment history
    - Connect "Request Verification" form to `POST /employments/request` with `{ companyId, position, startDate }`
    - Need company search/select for the form (company picker that searches `GET /companies?search=`)
    - Show real verification statuses (pending/approved/rejected)
  - **Reviews Tab**:
    - Fetch `GET /reviews/my-reviews` for user's reviews
    - Show edit button for reviews within 48h window (`can_edit_until` field)
    - Connect edit to `PATCH /reviews/:id`
    - Connect delete to `DELETE /reviews/:id`
  - **Feedback Tab**:
    - Fetch `GET /feedback/received` for feedback about the user
    - Display real category scores and comments
    - Optionally add "Feedback Given" section using `GET /feedback/given`

- [ ] **3.3** `InternalFeedbackPage.jsx` — Connect to real API:
  - Replace hardcoded coworkers list — need to fetch coworkers from same company
    - Option A: `GET /employments` to get own company → then some way to list company employees
    - Option B: Backend may need a new endpoint, OR use the company admin's employee list
    - **Decision needed**: How to list coworkers. Possible: `GET /companies/:id/employees` (doesn't exist yet) or use employment data
  - On submit: call `POST /feedback` with `{ toEmployeeId, scores: { professionalism, communication, teamwork, reliability }, comment }`
  - Handle quarterly limit enforcement (backend returns 400 if already submitted this quarter)
  - Show success state, reset form

---

#### PHASE 4: Company Admin Dashboard
> For company_admin role users.

- [ ] **4.1** `CompanyAdminDashboard.jsx` — Identify admin's company:
  - On mount: use `user.companyId` (from auth context) or call `GET /auth/me` to get company info
  - Replace hardcoded "Stripe Dashboard" with real company name

- [ ] **4.2** Analytics Tab — Connect to real data:
  - Fetch `GET /companies/:id/stats` for stat cards (total reviews, avg rating, verified employees)
  - Fetch `GET /companies/:id/analytics` for charts (reviews over time, rating distribution)
  - Fetch `GET /feedback/received?employeeId=all` (or company-wide endpoint) for feedback summary

- [ ] **4.3** Requests Tab — Connect to real data:
  - Fetch `GET /employments/pending` for pending verification requests
  - Connect "Approve" button to `PATCH /employments/:id/approve`

  - Pre-fill form with real company data from `GET /companies/:id`
  - Connect "Save Changes" to `PATCH /companies/:id` with updated fields
  - Logo upload: may need a file upload endpoint (NOT in current backend — skip or add later)

---

#### PHASE 5: System Admin Panel
> For system_admin role users.

- [ ] **5.1** Overview Tab — Connect to real data:
  - Fetch `GET /admin/analytics` for platform stats (total users, companies, reviews, open reports)
  - Fetch `GET /admin/reports/stats` for report counts
  - Wire up quick action buttons to switch tabs

- [ ] **5.2** Reports Tab — Connect to real data:
  - Fetch `GET /admin/reports` for reported reviews list
  - Connect "Remove Review" to `PATCH /admin/reports/:id/resolve` with `{ action: 'remove' }`
  - Connect "Dismiss Report" to `PATCH /admin/reports/:id/resolve` with `{ action: 'dismiss' }`
  - Re-fetch after action, show confirmation

- [ ] **5.3** Companies Tab — Connect to real data:
  - Fetch `GET /admin/companies` (or `GET /admin/companies?verified=false`) for pending registrations
  - Connect "Approve" to `PATCH /admin/companies/:id/verify`

  - Connect Ban (suspend) icon to `PATCH /admin/users/:id/suspend`
  - Add unsuspend toggle (currently missing from UI) — conditional on user status
  - Connect Trash (delete) icon to `DELETE /admin/users/:id` with confirmation dialog
  - Connect Eye (view) icon to navigate to user profile or show detail modal

- [ ] **5.5** Audit Log Tab — Connect to real data:
  - Fetch `GET /admin/audit-logs` for real audit entries
  - Display with pagination if needed

---

#### PHASE 6: Profile & Account
> User profile management.

- [ ] **6.1** `ProfilePage.jsx` — Connect profile section:
  - On mount: fetch `GET /employees/:id` (use `user.id` from auth context) for real profile data
  - Connect "Save Changes" to `PATCH /employees/:id` with updated fields
  - Pre-fill all form fields with real data

- [ ] **6.2** Employment section — Connect to real data:
  - Fetch `GET /employments` for real employment history
  - Show real verification statuses

- [ ] **6.3** Activity section — Connect to real data:
  - Fetch `GET /reviews/my-reviews` for review count
  - Fetch `GET /feedback/given` + `GET /feedback/received` for feedback counts

- [ ] **6.4** Settings section — Connect account actions:
  - "Change Password" — could use `POST /auth/forgot-password` (self-service) or a new endpoint
    - **Note**: Backend has no `PATCH /auth/change-password` — user must use forgot-password flow, OR we skip this
  - "Delete Account" — connect to `DELETE /admin/users/:id` (self-delete) — check if backend allows self-delete
  - "Deactivate Account" — not in backend, skip or map to suspend

---

#### PHASE 7: Navbar & Navigation Polish
> Make the shell auth-aware.

- [ ] **7.1** `Navbar.jsx` — Make auth-aware:
  - Import `useAuth()` to get `user` and `logout`
  - Show Login/Register buttons when NOT logged in
  - Show profile dropdown with real user name/initials when logged in
  - Conditionally show nav links based on role:
    - Employee: Companies, Dashboard, Feedback
    - Company Admin: Companies, Dashboard (company), Feedback
    - System Admin: Companies, Admin Panel
  - Connect "Sign Out" button to `logout()` function
  - Show real notification count (future — skip for now)

- [ ] **7.2** `App.jsx` — Add missing routes:
  - `/verify-email/:token` → `VerifyEmailPage`
  - `/forgot-password` → `ForgotPasswordPage`
  - `/reset-password/:token` → `ResetPasswordPage`
  - Wrap protected routes with `ProtectedRoute` / `RoleRoute`

---

#### PHASE 8: UX Polish & Edge Cases
> Final touches after all connections are made.

- [ ] **8.1** Loading states — Add skeleton loading to all pages that fetch data
- [ ] **8.2** Error handling — Global error toast/notification system
- [ ] **8.3** Empty states — Design "no data" states for all lists (no reviews, no employments, etc.)
- [ ] **8.4** 404 page — Add a proper not-found page for invalid routes
- [ ] **8.5** Responsive testing — Verify mobile layout on all connected pages
- [ ] **8.6** Token expiry UX — Show "session expired" notification and redirect to login

**🧪 Postman Testing Guide — Raneem Days 3–4**

> **Prerequisites**: Run `cd backend && npm run dev`. Have 2 accounts ready — one regular user (employee) and one `company_admin`. Get their tokens via `POST /api/auth/login`.

**Test 1 — Employee profile (GET)**
```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/employees/:id
# No token needed — public profile
# If profileVisibility = "private" → should return 404 for non-owners
```

**Test 2 — Update profile (PATCH)**
```
PATCH http://localhost:5000/api/employees/:id
Authorization: Bearer <employeeToken>
Body (JSON): { "fullName": "Raneem Test", "bio": "hello", "profileVisibility": "private" }

# Test wrong user's token → expect 403 Forbidden
# Test invalid profileVisibility value → expect 400
```

**Test 3 — Submit employment request + email**
```
POST http://localhost:5000/api/employments/request
Authorization: Bearer <employeeToken>
Body (JSON): { "companyId": "<uuid>", "position": "Engineer", "startDate": "2024-01-01" }

# Expect 201 — company admin should receive email notification
# Submit again for same company → expect 400 "already exists"
```

**Test 4 — Admin views pending requests**
```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/employments/pending
Authorization: Bearer <adminToken>

# Expect list containing the request above
# Try with employee token → expect 403
```

**Test 5 — Approve employment + email**
```
PATCH http://localhost:5000/api/employments/<id>/approve
Authorization: Bearer <adminToken>

# Expect 200 — employee should receive approval email
```

**Test 6 — End employment**
```
PATCH http://localhost:5000/api/employments/<id>/end
Authorization: Bearer <employeeToken>
Body (JSON): { "endDate": "2025-12-31" }

# Expect 200 with is_current: false
# Call again → expect 400 "Employment already ended"
```

**Test 7 — Reject employment (create a new request first)**
```
PATCH http://localhost:5000/api/employments/<id>/reject
Authorization: Bearer <adminToken>
Body (JSON): { "rejectionNote": "Could not verify employment" }

# Expect 200 — employee should receive rejection email with reason
```

**Test 8 — Feedback rating validation (BUG-001 fix)**
```
POST http://localhost:5000/api/feedback
Authorization: Bearer <employeeToken>
Body (JSON): { "professionalism": 6, ... }

# Expect 400 — must be 1–5 (previously this would crash with DB error)
```

## ⚠️ KNOWN BUGS

### ✅ BUG-007 — Walid: suspend/unsuspend email uses email as name
**File**: `backend/src/services/adminService.js`  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED — Baraa (code review)  
**Owner**: Walid  
**Problem**: `sendAccountSuspendedEmail({ to: user.email, name: user.email, reason })` — passes `user.email` as the `name` field. Email greeting shows "Hi john@example.com" instead of "Hi John".  
**Fix**: Added `full_name` to both select queries, passing `user.full_name || user.email` as name.

### ✅ BUG-001 — Raneem: Feedback rating validation 1-10 vs DB constraint 1-5
**File**: `backend/src/controllers/feedbackController.js`  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED — commit `93054f7`  
**Owner**: Raneem  
**Problem**: Controller validates professionalism, communication, teamwork, reliability as integers `1–10`. But the DB schema has hard CHECK constraints: `CHECK (professionalism >= 1 AND professionalism <= 5)`. Any value 6–10 passes controller validation but gets **rejected by Supabase with a constraint error** (no helpful error message to user).  
**Also**: year min is `2000` in controller but `2020` in schema — minor mismatch.  
**Fix**:
```js
// In feedbackController.js — change all 4:
!isIntInRange(professionalism, 1, 5)  // was 1, 10
!isIntInRange(communication, 1, 5)    // was 1, 10
!isIntInRange(teamwork, 1, 5)         // was 1, 10
!isIntInRange(reliability, 1, 5)      // was 1, 10
// Also: year < 2020  (was 2000)
```

### ✅ BUG-002 — Aya: reportReview missing reason validation
**File**: `backend/src/services/reviewService.js` → `reportReview()`  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED — commit `e42f767`  
**Owner**: Aya  
**Problem**: DB has constraint `reason IN ('false_info', 'spam', 'harassment', 'other')`. The service inserts `reason` directly without validating the value. An invalid reason string causes a raw Supabase constraint error instead of a clean 400 response.  
**Fix**: Add before the insert:
```js
const validReasons = ['false_info', 'spam', 'harassment', 'other'];
if (!validReasons.includes(reason)) {
  throw new AppError('Invalid reason. Must be one of: false_info, spam, harassment, other', 400);
}
```

### ✅ BUG-003 — Aya: duplicate checkVerifiedEmployment (not using Raneem's helper)
**File**: `backend/src/services/reviewService.js`  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED — commit `e42f767`  
**Owner**: Aya  
**Problem**: Aya has her own inline copy of `checkVerifiedEmployment()` instead of using `helpers/checkVerifiedEmployment.js` that Raneem built for her. Two copies of the same logic — if one is updated the other won't be.  
**Fix**: Replace inline function with `const checkVerifiedEmployment = require('../helpers/checkVerifiedEmployment');`

### ✅ BUG-004 — Raneem: Controller code accidentally placed in feedbackService.js
**File**: `backend/src/services/feedbackService.js`  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED — Baraa (code review)  
**Problem**: `exports.createFeedback = async (req, res) => {...}` — a full controller function with `req/res` was sitting at the top of the service file. It called `feedbackService.createFeedback()` on itself causing infinite recursion. Harmless only because `module.exports` at the bottom overrode it.
**Fix**: Removed the dead controller block (lines 3–72). Real `createFeedback` service function at the bottom is correct.

### ✅ BUG-005 — Raneem: Employment email notifications not called
**File**: `backend/src/controllers/employmentController.js`  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED — Baraa (code review)  
**Problem**: `requestEmployment`, `approveEmployment`, `rejectEmployment` never called any email functions despite being a Days 3-4 requirement.
**Fix**: Baraa added non-blocking email calls in all 3 functions using `sendEmploymentRequestEmail`, `sendEmploymentApprovedEmail`, `sendEmploymentRejectedEmail` from `emailService.js`.

### ✅ BUG-006 — Raneem: Wrong email package added to package.json
**File**: `backend/package.json`  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED — Baraa (code review)  
**Problem**: Raneem added `@sendgrid/mail` — we use Resend SDK, not SendGrid. Unused dependency.
**Fix**: Removed `@sendgrid/mail` from `package.json`.

## 📝 IMPORTANT NOTES

### For All Team Members
1. **DO NOT commit `.env` file** - It contains secrets
2. **Server must run from backend folder**: `cd backend && npm run dev`
3. **Database test**: Run `cd backend && node test-database.js` to verify connection
4. **Middleware is REAL** (not stub): Auth is active — all protected routes require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
5. **Email**: Resend SDK configured — set `RESEND_API_KEY` in `.env` to send real emails

### For Backend Developers
- Use `utils/validators.js` for all endpoint validation
- Use `middlewares/errorHandler.js` AppError class for errors
- Follow REST conventions: GET (list/get), POST (create), PUT (update), DELETE (delete)
- All services should interact with Supabase using `config/database.js`
- Rate limiters already configured: Import from `middlewares/rateLimiter.js`

### For Frontend Developers
- API Base URL: `http://localhost:5000`
- All endpoints will be under `/api/v1/` prefix (not implemented yet)
- CORS enabled for `http://localhost:5173`
- Standard response format (will be documented when endpoints created)

### 2026-02-24 — Baraa: Day 6 Security Hardening + 17 Security Tests (87/87) ✅

**Summary**: Implemented all Day 6 security tasks and added 17 security tests to the Newman collection. All 87 requests / 91 assertions passing.

**New files**:
- `backend/src/middlewares/sanitize.js` — `sanitizeBody` (recursive XSS strip via `xss` package, no allowed tags) + `sanitizeSearch` (strips PostgREST injection chars, caps at 100 chars)

**Files modified**:
- `backend/src/app.js` — Helmet hardened (HSTS 1yr+preload, frameguard DENY, noSniff, no-referrer), CORS multi-origin support + locked methods/headers, `express.json({ limit: '10kb' })`, `sanitizeBody` applied globally

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Server won't start
- Check if port 5000 is already in use
- Verify `.env` file exists in `backend/` folder
- Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are installed

### Database connection fails
- Verify Supabase credentials in `.env`
- Check internet connection
- Run `node test-database.js` for detailed error

### Middleware rejecting requests
- Confirm middleware is in STUB MODE (check `authMiddleware.js`)
- Production middleware should remain commented until auth complete

### Tests failing
- Ensure database schema is deployed
- Check if RLS needs to be disabled (run `disable-rls.sql`)
- Verify test data doesn't conflict with existing data
