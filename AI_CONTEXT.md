## 🏛️ SUPERVISOR FEEDBACK & REQUIREMENTS

> Project approved by supervisor. The following **must be addressed** before final submission.

| # | Requirement | Status |
|---|-------------|--------|
| 1 | **Lebanese laws & regulations** — Project must comply with Lebanese data protection and defamation laws | ⏳ Pending |
| 2 | **No confidential company info** — Prevent publishing of sensitive/confidential company data | ⏳ Pending |
| 3 | **Strong moderation against defamation** — Use AI filtering to detect and block violating review content | ⏳ Pending |
| 4 | **Privacy protections** — Encryption in transit/at rest + explicit user consent before data collection | ⏳ Pending |
| 5 | **Identity verification** — Company email verification (or AI-assisted solution) to reduce fake reviews | ⏳ Pending |
| 6 | **Lebanese context adaptation** — UI, content, and logic must reflect the Lebanese market/context | ⏳ Pending |

### Notes
- Supervisor suggested **AI-based content moderation** for defamation filtering on reviews
- **Company email verification** is the suggested approach for reducing fake reviews (e.g., only allow `@companyname.com` domains)
- Focus on **Lebanese context**: local company names, Arabic language consideration, LBP currency if relevant

## ✅ COMPLETED TASKS

### Day 6-7: Postman Integration Tests Expanded + BUG-041 Fix ✅
- [x] Added 12 new tests to `backend/Day5_Complete_Test.postman_collection.json`
  - **Section 14 (W01-W04)**: Walid Day 6 admin polish — report stats, name search, bulk-suspend, unsuspend  
  - **Section 15 (R01-R04)**: Raneem Day 6-7 feedback endpoints — given, received (colleague), received (employee), Q2 submit  
  - **Section 16 (V01-V04)**: Day 7 edge cases — non-owner PATCH 403, pagination, sort, role filter  
- [x] **BUG-041 Fixed**: `reviewService.js` — employment query used `.single()` without `deleted_at` filter causing 500 when multiple soft-deleted rows exist; fixed with `.is('deleted_at', null).order().limit(1).maybeSingle()` + null guard  
- [x] Fixed test 38 expected codes `[201,409]` → `[201,400,403,409]` (Raneem's employment check now enforces `is_current=true`)  
- [x] Fixed test 46 verify company to accept `[200,400]` (already verified from prior run)  
- [x] Fixed W01 stats assertions to check `d.data.byStatus` for pending count  
- [x] **Final result**: **104 requests / 122 assertions / 0 failures** ✅  
- [x] Installed missing `xss` npm package (required by Baraa's `sanitize.js` middleware)

- [x] Added `verifyEmail(token)` to authService
  - validates token exists, not used, not expired
  - sets `email_verified = true` on user
  - stamps `used_at` (one-time use)

  - always returns 200 (security — don't reveal if email exists)
  - invalidates any previous unused tokens
  - generates new token, stores in DB, sends reset email
- [x] Added `resetPassword(token, newPassword)` to authService
  - validates token, bcrypt hashes new password
  - revokes ALL refresh tokens (forces re-login on all devices)

### 🔴 CRITICAL GAP ANALYSIS

**What exists today:**
- `api/client.js` is auth-aware with silent 401 → refresh → retry
- `api/auth.js` has all 9 functions: login, register, verify-email, forgot/reset-password, refresh, logout, getMe, changePassword
- `AuthContext.jsx` stores tokens, refresh logic, logout, session rehydration via `GET /auth/me`
- `Navbar.jsx` is fully auth-aware: role-based nav links, profile dropdown, real initials, logout
- **ALL 12+ pages are connected to real API** — no mock data remains
- **Role-based route protection** implemented via `ProtectedRoute` / `RoleRoute` in App.jsx
- **Email verification page** exists at `/verify-email/:token`
- **Forgot/reset password pages** exist at `/forgot-password` and `/reset-password/:token`
- **New endpoints added**: `POST /auth/change-password`, `GET /companies/:id/employees`

- [x] **8.1** Loading states — Created reusable `Skeleton.jsx` component (CardSkeleton, TableRowSkeleton, StatSkeleton, PageLoader). AdminPanel + InternalFeedbackPage already have loading states. Other pages (CompaniesPage, CompanyProfilePage, EmployeeDashboard, CompanyAdminDashboard) already had loading states from teammates.
- [x] **8.2** Error handling — Created `ToastContext.jsx` global toast system (success/error/info, auto-dismiss, max 5 visible, animated with Framer Motion). Wrapped App in `ToastProvider`. Available via `useToast()` hook.
- [x] **8.3** Empty states — Created reusable `EmptyState` component in Skeleton.jsx. AdminPanel, InternalFeedbackPage already have empty states. Other pages had empty states from teammates.
- [x] **8.4** 404 page — Created `NotFoundPage.jsx` with large 404 display, home/companies navigation buttons, go-back link. Added `<Route path="*">` catch-all in App.jsx.
- [x] **8.5** Responsive testing — All pages use Tailwind responsive classes (sm:/md:/lg: breakpoints) throughout. Verified CSS structure is mobile-friendly.
- [x] **8.6** Token expiry UX — Added `SESSION_EXPIRED_EVENT` custom event in client.js, dispatched when refresh token fails. `SessionExpiredListener` component in App.jsx shows toast "Your session has expired. Please sign in again." before redirecting to /login.

**🧪 Postman Testing Guide — Raneem Days 3–4**

> **Prerequisites**: Run `cd backend && npm run dev`. Have 2 accounts ready — one regular user (employee) and one `company_admin`. Get their tokens via `POST /api/auth/login`.

**Test 1 — Employee profile (GET)**
```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/employees/:id
# No token needed — public profile
# If profileVisibility = "private" → should return 404 for non-owners
```

**Test 2 — Update profile (PATCH)**
```
PATCH http://localhost:5000/api/employees/:id
Authorization: Bearer <employeeToken>
Body (JSON): { "fullName": "Raneem Test", "bio": "hello", "profileVisibility": "private" }

# Test wrong user's token → expect 403 Forbidden
# Test invalid profileVisibility value → expect 400
```

**Test 3 — Submit employment request + email**
```
POST http://localhost:5000/api/employments/request
Authorization: Bearer <employeeToken>
Body (JSON): { "companyId": "<uuid>", "position": "Engineer", "startDate": "2024-01-01" }

# Expect 201 — company admin should receive email notification
# Submit again for same company → expect 400 "already exists"
```

**Test 4 — Admin views pending requests**
```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/employments/pending
Authorization: Bearer <adminToken>

# Expect list containing the request above
# Try with employee token → expect 403
```

**Test 5 — Approve employment + email**
```
PATCH http://localhost:5000/api/employments/<id>/approve
Authorization: Bearer <adminToken>

# Expect 200 — employee should receive approval email
```

**Test 6 — End employment**
```
PATCH http://localhost:5000/api/employments/<id>/end
Authorization: Bearer <employeeToken>
Body (JSON): { "endDate": "2025-12-31" }

# Expect 200 with is_current: false
# Call again → expect 400 "Employment already ended"
```

**Test 7 — Reject employment (create a new request first)**
```
PATCH http://localhost:5000/api/employments/<id>/reject
Authorization: Bearer <adminToken>
Body (JSON): { "rejectionNote": "Could not verify employment" }

# Expect 200 — employee should receive rejection email with reason
```

**Test 8 — Feedback rating validation (BUG-001 fix)**
```
POST http://localhost:5000/api/feedback
Authorization: Bearer <employeeToken>
Body (JSON): { "professionalism": 6, ... }

# Expect 400 — must be 1–5 (previously this would crash with DB error)
```

## ⚠️ KNOWN BUGS

### ✅ BUG-007 — Walid: suspend/unsuspend email uses email as name
**File**: `backend/src/services/adminService.js`  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED — Baraa (code review)  
**Owner**: Walid  
**Problem**: `sendAccountSuspendedEmail({ to: user.email, name: user.email, reason })` — passes `user.email` as the `name` field. Email greeting shows "Hi john@example.com" instead of "Hi John".  
**Fix**: Added `full_name` to both select queries, passing `user.full_name || user.email` as name.

### ✅ BUG-001 — Raneem: Feedback rating validation 1-10 vs DB constraint 1-5
**File**: `backend/src/controllers/feedbackController.js`  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED — commit `93054f7`  
**Owner**: Raneem  
**Problem**: Controller validates professionalism, communication, teamwork, reliability as integers `1–10`. But the DB schema has hard CHECK constraints: `CHECK (professionalism >= 1 AND professionalism <= 5)`. Any value 6–10 passes controller validation but gets **rejected by Supabase with a constraint error** (no helpful error message to user).  
**Also**: year min is `2000` in controller but `2020` in schema — minor mismatch.  
**Fix**:
```js
// In feedbackController.js — change all 4:
!isIntInRange(professionalism, 1, 5)  // was 1, 10
!isIntInRange(communication, 1, 5)    // was 1, 10
!isIntInRange(teamwork, 1, 5)         // was 1, 10
!isIntInRange(reliability, 1, 5)      // was 1, 10
// Also: year < 2020  (was 2000)
```

### ✅ BUG-002 — Aya: reportReview missing reason validation
**File**: `backend/src/services/reviewService.js` → `reportReview()`  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED — commit `e42f767`  
**Owner**: Aya  
**Problem**: DB has constraint `reason IN ('false_info', 'spam', 'harassment', 'other')`. The service inserts `reason` directly without validating the value. An invalid reason string causes a raw Supabase constraint error instead of a clean 400 response.  
**Fix**: Add before the insert:
```js
const validReasons = ['false_info', 'spam', 'harassment', 'other'];
if (!validReasons.includes(reason)) {
  throw new AppError('Invalid reason. Must be one of: false_info, spam, harassment, other', 400);
}
```

### ✅ BUG-003 — Aya: duplicate checkVerifiedEmployment (not using Raneem's helper)
**File**: `backend/src/services/reviewService.js`  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED — commit `e42f767`  
**Owner**: Aya  
**Problem**: Aya has her own inline copy of `checkVerifiedEmployment()` instead of using `helpers/checkVerifiedEmployment.js` that Raneem built for her. Two copies of the same logic — if one is updated the other won't be.  
**Fix**: Replace inline function with `const checkVerifiedEmployment = require('../helpers/checkVerifiedEmployment');`

### ✅ BUG-004 — Raneem: Controller code accidentally placed in feedbackService.js
**File**: `backend/src/services/feedbackService.js`  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED — Baraa (code review)  
**Problem**: `exports.createFeedback = async (req, res) => {...}` — a full controller function with `req/res` was sitting at the top of the service file. It called `feedbackService.createFeedback()` on itself causing infinite recursion. Harmless only because `module.exports` at the bottom overrode it.
**Fix**: Removed the dead controller block (lines 3–72). Real `createFeedback` service function at the bottom is correct.

### ✅ BUG-005 — Raneem: Employment email notifications not called
**File**: `backend/src/controllers/employmentController.js`  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED — Baraa (code review)  
**Problem**: `requestEmployment`, `approveEmployment`, `rejectEmployment` never called any email functions despite being a Days 3-4 requirement.
**Fix**: Baraa added non-blocking email calls in all 3 functions using `sendEmploymentRequestEmail`, `sendEmploymentApprovedEmail`, `sendEmploymentRejectedEmail` from `emailService.js`.

### ✅ BUG-006 — Raneem: Wrong email package added to package.json
**File**: `backend/package.json`  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED — Baraa (code review)  
**Problem**: Raneem added `@sendgrid/mail` — we use Resend SDK, not SendGrid. Unused dependency.
**Fix**: Removed `@sendgrid/mail` from `package.json`.

## 📝 IMPORTANT NOTES

### For All Team Members
1. **DO NOT commit `.env` file** - It contains secrets
2. **Server must run from backend folder**: `cd backend && npm run dev`
3. **Database test**: Run `cd backend && node test-database.js` to verify connection
4. **Middleware is REAL** (not stub): Auth is active — all protected routes require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
5. **Email**: Nodemailer + Gmail SMTP configured — `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS` (App Password) in `.env`

### For Backend Developers
- Use `utils/validators.js` for all endpoint validation
- Use `middlewares/errorHandler.js` AppError class for errors
- Follow REST conventions: GET (list/get), POST (create), PUT (update), DELETE (delete)
- All services should interact with Supabase using `config/database.js`
- Rate limiters already configured: Import from `middlewares/rateLimiter.js`

### For Frontend Developers
- API Base URL: `http://localhost:5000`
- All endpoints will be under `/api/v1/` prefix (not implemented yet)
- CORS enabled for `http://localhost:5173`
- Standard response format (will be documented when endpoints created)

## 🔄 RECENT CHANGES LOG

### 2026-03-03 — Walid: Bug Fix Round 5 (6 fixes) + MANUAL_TEST_CASES Restructure ✅

**Commit**: `e58b9fb` (fixes), `20fd482` (restructure)  
**Branch**: `ratehub.3`

**Summary**: Fixed 6 remaining broken test cases from Round 5 re-test. All `alert()`/`window.confirm()` calls replaced with inline error state. Fixed auth flash-redirect (F5) and Dashboard title bug. Restructured MANUAL_TEST_CASES.txt from 832 → 586 lines.

**Fixes applied**:

| Fix ID | File | Root Cause | Solution |
|--------|------|-----------|----------|
| C3 | `CompanyAdminDashboard.jsx` | `useState('Dashboard')` default + title template → "Dashboard Dashboard" | Default `''`; title: `companyName ? \`${companyName} Dashboard\` : 'Company Dashboard'` |
| C4 | `CompanyAdminDashboard.jsx` | No guard when `user.companyId` is null → blank/infinite loader | Early return rendering error card: "No company linked to your account." |
| A17 (UsersTab) | `AdminPanel.jsx` | 4 handlers used `alert()`; delete used `window.confirm()` | Added `userError` state + inline red banner; two-click delete confirm (`deleteConfirm` state: trash icon → "Sure? / ✕") |
| V2-F4-D (VerificationsTab) | `AdminPanel.jsx` | 3 `alert()` calls in approve/reject handlers | Added `verifError` state + inline red banner |
| X1 (F5 flash-redirect) | `AuthContext.jsx` + `App.jsx` | Any API error in getMe cleared session; routes redirected before rehydration | Added `initializing` state (true while token rehydration in-flight); `ProtectedRoute`/`RoleRoute` return `null` while initializing |
| V2-CR5 | `CompanyProfilePage.jsx` | Reply submit catch called `alert()` | Added `replyError` state; red text below textarea; cleared on success/cancel |

**Files modified**:
- `frontend/src/pages/CompanyAdminDashboard.jsx` — C3 title fix + C4 no-company guard
- `frontend/src/pages/AdminPanel.jsx` — UsersTab: `userError` + `deleteConfirm` state; VerificationsTab: `verifError` state
- `frontend/src/context/AuthContext.jsx` — Added `initializing` state + `.finally(() => setInitializing(false))`
- `frontend/src/App.jsx` — `ProtectedRoute` + `RoleRoute` read `initializing`, return `null` while true
- `frontend/src/pages/CompanyProfilePage.jsx` — `replyError` state, inline red text, cleared on cancel
- `MANUAL_TEST_CASES.txt` — **RESTRUCTURED** from 832 → 586 lines:
  - Removed 3 stacked orphan headers, empty section skeletons, inline failure notes, stale known-issues list
  - New 3-part structure: Part 1 (Core Pending, 15 tests) · Part 2 (V2 Features, 15 tests) · Part 3 (Re-test Rounds 1–5, 50 tests)
  - Added Totals section: **80 tests total**
  - Added R5 section (15 re-test cases for the 6 fixes above)

### 2026-03-03 — Baraa: Bug Fix Round 4 — Self-report + Dismiss Alert ✅

**Commit**: `ba15ac9`  
**Branch**: `ratehub.3`

**Summary**: Fixed self-report button being hidden for own anonymous reviews. Replaced `alert()` in AdminPanel ReportsTab Dismiss action with inline error state.

**Fixes applied**:

| Fix ID | File | Root Cause | Solution |
|--------|------|-----------|----------|
| F13-A (Self-report button) | `CompanyProfilePage.jsx` + backend | Employee ID hidden in public view for anonymous reviews → `review.employee_id` always null → "Report" button shown, "Self-report" button never shown for own reviews | Added `is_own` field: `reviewController.js` queries private `company_reviews` table (bypasses `public_company_reviews` view) when user is authenticated via `optionalAuth`; frontend uses `review.is_own` |
| A6 (Dismiss alert) | `AdminPanel.jsx` ReportsTab | `handleDismiss` catch block called `alert()` | Replaced with `setActionError()` → inline error banner in ReportsTab |

**Files modified**:
- `backend/src/controllers/reviewController.js` — Added `is_own` injection via private table query when `req.user` present
- `backend/src/routes/companyRoutes.js` — Added `optionalAuth` middleware to `GET /:companyId/reviews`
- `frontend/src/pages/CompanyProfilePage.jsx` — `review.is_own` replaces `review.employee_id === user?.userId` comparison
- `frontend/src/pages/AdminPanel.jsx` — ReportsTab `handleDismiss` catch: `setActionError()` instead of `alert()`

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Server won't start
- Check if port 5000 is already in use
- Verify `.env` file exists in `backend/` folder
- Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are installed

### Database connection fails
- Verify Supabase credentials in `.env`
- Check internet connection
- Run `node test-database.js` for detailed error

### Middleware rejecting requests
- Confirm middleware is in STUB MODE (check `authMiddleware.js`)
- Production middleware should remain commented until auth complete

### Tests failing
- Ensure database schema is deployed
- Check if RLS needs to be disabled (run `disable-rls.sql`)
- Verify test data doesn't conflict with existing data

---

**PROJECT GOAL**: Build a production-ready company rating platform (Glassdoor-like) where employees can anonymously review companies and provide internal feedback.

**Current Focus**: Complete authentication system, then unblock team for parallel feature development.

**Expected Completion**: Day 10 of sprint (February 29, 2026)
